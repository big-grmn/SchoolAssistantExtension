# SchoolAssistantExtension

This is an extension that helps with your homework.

Extension can show answers for [SkySmart](https://edu.skysmart.ru) / [Resh](https://resh.edu.ru) / [Obrazovaka](https://obrazovaka.ru) / [Imumk](https://mo.imumk.ru).

It can skip video advertisement on [Znanija](https://znanija.com/)

Also it provides some improvements for https://schools.school.mosreg.ru/ (by default it has GDZ for my school curricula and schedule but you can change it in schoolmosreg.js):
