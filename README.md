# SchoolAssistantExtension

This is an extension that helps with your homework.

Since the last release, it can show answers for [Resh](https://resh.edu.ru) / [Obrazovaka](https://obrazovaka.ru) / [Imumk](https://mo.imumk.ru).
For that, it uses scripts from my repos.

Also it have some improvements for https://schools.school.mosreg.ru/ (by default it has GDZ for my school curricula and schedule but you can change it in schoolmosreg.js):
